## Problem
The Bureau of Transportation Statistics regularly makes available data on the number of vehicles, equipment, passengers and pedestrians crossing into the United States by land.

**For this challenge, I calculated the total number of times vehicles, equipment, passengers and pedestrians cross the U.S.-Canadian and U.S.-Mexican borders each month. I also found the running monthly average of total number of crossings for that type of crossing and border from the input dataset provided.**


## Important fields
Border: Designates what border was crossed
Date: Timestamp indicating month and year of crossing
Measure: Indicates means, or type, of crossing being measured (e.g., vehicle, equipment, passenger or pedestrian)
Value: Number of crossings

## Language and Libraries Used
I used Python3 as my coding language to solve this problem. I implemented the solution using basic data structure building blocks and software engineering best practices (by writing clean, modular, and well-tested code).
